**Experimenting with a lifestyle of ecologically sustainability and social justice in South Africa.**

# Intro

This idea draws its name from Projet Kamp, but has no official affiliation with that project. We are simply using the name as a placeholder, and easy reference point to something which illustrates the vision.

The what: A model of an alterntive way of living in South Africa - racially diverse, locally-oriented, environmentally sustainable, without the stress and bills of city life. 

# painting a vision:

Living in Cape Town, we see a whole lot of problems that seem overwhelming. Even if we could figure out what to prioritise, it is hard to find the time to put meaningful work into being part of the solution for anything when we have to work to pay rent and afford food. Within the constraints of city living, they appear impossible to overcome. 

If we lift the constraint of needing to live in the city, however, things start to look a whole lot more possible.

De-urbanise. For:
- a quieter life
- a lower carbon footprint
- a more community-focused life
- beautiful surroundings
- control over your environment
- space to do work you find satisfying
- a chance at more integrated community 

## What are the problems we see:

- climate change 
    - food insecurity
    - desertification
    - reliance on coal-powered grid, and lack of control over energy generation
- poverty and inequality
    - people were dispossesed of land, and no restitution has happened
    - there isn't enough room and infrastructure in the city to support everyone

At an individual level, we are busy all the time, and rarely satisfied with our work at the end of the day. We need to work enough to pay our rent every month - thousand of hours and rands which go towards paying off someone else's mortgage. We're aware of climate 

As long as we're in the city, it feels like we can only fight the symptoms of the problems, and talk in abstract terms about what the solutions could be. Getting rural, onto some cheaper land, and suddenly there is a lot more space to experiment with what solutions could look like. 

Trying to engage with social problems in the city is frustrating, because you so often run up against the reality that you don't have the power to actually change anything. Property owners and the government are the ones with practical power, and instead of just getting to the actual work of iterating on potential solutions to complex problems, it seems one needs to spend all their time trying to lobby support and public interest towards 

It seems reasonable to imagine that we could model a new way of life that addresses many of these issues at once, in a way that actually looks attractive to other people in the city - who might want to try it out and replicate it. 

## What challenges do we expect

# working towards KampZA

## Broad Strokes

1. Explore what's out there
    1.1: if what we want already exists: figure out how to join it
2. If we want doesn't exist/what exists is full: build what we want/replicate what exists

Three phases:
1. Exploration
2. Implementation
3. Replication



### Exploration
1. Initial exploration: preparing ourselves and seeing what's already out there
    1. See what's out there 
    2. Join the network
        * IJC might be interested?
    3. Grow a team
        * videographer (filmer + editor)
        * craftspeople/makers (woodworker, metalworker, general DIY)
        * restitution specialist/local "expert"
        * farmers (agriculture, regen-ag, permaulture, animal farming/animal husbandry)
        * electronics/computer person? 
        * social cohesion person (pastoral care)
        * project facilitator/coordinator
        * general labour

    4. Pick up some skills
2. Vision-building and concrete planning
3. Find some land
4. Get ready to move onto the land
5. Move onto the land
